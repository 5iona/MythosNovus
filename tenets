THE TENETS OF  

MYTHOS NOVUS  

We live in a benevolent universe.

Love is the source of all things, and the only true power.

We are each individual expressions of the Divine (God), which is both the prime creative intelligence in the universe and the unified totality of all in existence.

Our cosmic destiny and divine birthright is the collective realization of a future in which every being fully realizes its highest destiny.

We manifest that future through the revelation of a new mythology, both personal and collective, and by aligning ourselves with our own direct connection to God as the prime creative intelligence, which seeks to work through us to deliver that mythology into the world of form.

We need your voice.
