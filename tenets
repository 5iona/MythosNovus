THE TENETS OF  

MYTHOS NOVUS  

We live in a benevolent universe.

Love is the source of all things, and the only true power.

We are each individual expressions of the Divine (God), which is both the prime creative intelligence in the universe and the unified totality of all in existence.

Your cosmic inheritance and divine birthright is the collective realization of a future in which every being fully realizes its highest destiny.

We manifest that future through the revelation of a new mythology.

We welcome your voice.
